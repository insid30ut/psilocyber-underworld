Regardless of the technique, successful cultivation depends on managing these factors:

*   **Substrate:** The food source, such as straw, wood chips, sawdust, or coco coir.
*   **Sterilization/Pasteurization:** Heating the substrate to eliminate competitors (molds/bacteria).
*   **Inoculation:** Introducing spawn (mycelium) into the substrate.
*   **Incubation:** Placing colonized substrate in a warm (70-78°F), dark place for mycelium to spread.
*   **Fruiting:** Introducing light, fresh air, and high humidity (90-95%) to trigger mushroom formation.
*   **Light Cycle:** A 12-hour on/off cycle using 6000K-6500K LED light can increase yields by up to 38%.
