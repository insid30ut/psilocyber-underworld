Success in mycology often depends on your ability to read the mycelium and adjust environmental variables. This guide covers the most common failure points from spawning to bulk through harvest.

**Objective:** Diagnose growth stalls, identify competitors, and optimize environmental triggers to ensure a successful flush.

### Phase 1: Growth & Colonization Issues

*Before assuming contamination, verify that your temperature, hydration, and gas exchange are within the optimal parameters for your specific species.*

1. **Stalled Mycelium:** If growth stops abruptly, it is often due to **moisture imbalance** or **CO2 buildup**.
* **Check Field Capacity:** Substrate that is too wet suffocates mycelium. If the bottom of the tub looks "slushy," flip the lid to increase evaporation.
* **Temperature Swings:** Mycelium generates its own heat. If ambient temps exceed 80°F, the internal tub temp can reach levels that kill or stall growth.


2. **Overlay & Stroma:** Dense, thick, leather-like white growth that refuses to pin.
* **Cause:** Usually caused by low humidity combined with excessive Fresh Air Exchange (FAE), or genetic predisposition.
* **Fix:** Lightly "fork" the surface to break the mat and apply a fresh, thin casing layer of pasteurized peat or CVG to re-induce a microclimate.



### Phase 2: Environmental Indicators

| Symptom | Probable Cause | Corrective Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Fuzzy Feet** | High CO2 / Low FAE | Increase lid gap or fanning frequency. |
| **Leggy/Thin Stems** | Low Light / High CO2 | Increase light exposure and air exchange. |
| **Mushroom Aborts** | Stress / Dry Surface | Remove small, dark-capped pins; mist walls immediately. |
| **Yellow Droplets** | Metabolites ("Pee") | Mycelium is stressed or fighting bacteria. Check temps. |

1. **Aborts:** Recognized by pins that stop growing and develop dark, often pointed caps.
* *Prevention:* Avoid direct spraying of young pins. Maintain a "cold soda can" level of condensation on the tub walls at all times.


2. **Fuzzy Feet/Caps:** Fine white fuzz at the base or white dots on the caps.
* *Insight:* This is not contamination; it is the mycelium "reaching" for oxygen. It is the most common indicator that your FAE is insufficient.



### Phase 3: Contamination Management

*If you suspect contamination, isolate the tub from your grow space immediately to prevent spore load buildup.*

* **Trichoderma (Green Mold):** Starts as a bright, thick white patch (whiter than mycelium) before turning green as it sporulates. **Action:** If it’s green, the tub is lost. Do not open it indoors.
* **Cobweb Mold:** Fast-growing, gray, wispy fibers that "hover" above the substrate.
* **The Peroxide Test:** Spray with 3% $H_2O_2$. Cobweb will melt instantly; healthy mycelium will not.


* **Bacterial Blobs/Sour Rot:** Characterized by a "sweaty" appearance on grains and a distinct sour or fermented odor.
* **Cause:** Usually improper grain sterilization or over-hydrated substrate.

### Pro-Tips for Commercial Scalability

* **Repeatable Cleanliness:** Transition from a Still Air Box (SAB) to a HEPA-filtered Laminar Flow Hood as soon as volume demands it.
* **Documentation:** Use a "Project State" rule to log the date of spawn, substrate ratios, and the date of first pins to identify which variables yield the highest Biological Efficiency (BE).
