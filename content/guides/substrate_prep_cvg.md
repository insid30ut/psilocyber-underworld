## CVG Substrate Preparation

For commercial-grade consistency and optimized mycelial run times, the CVG (Coir, Vermiculite, Gypsum) method remains the industry standard. Below is the refined protocol emphasizing efficient brick breakdown and precise hydration.

### CVG Formula Ratios

| Component | Quantity | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Coco Coir** | 650g (1 standard brick) | Primary carbon source/structural matrix |
| **Vermiculite** | 2 Quarts (8 cups) | Aeration and moisture retention |
| **Gypsum** | 1 Cup | Calcium/Sulfur source; prevents clumping |
| **Boiling Water** | 3.5 - 4.5 Quarts | Pasteurization and hydration |

### Step-by-Step Protocol

#### 1. Initial Softening

Place the dry 650g coco coir brick into a heavy-duty, heat-resistant 5-gallon bucket. Pour **0.5 quarts (approx. 500ml) of boiling water** directly onto the brick. Cover for 5–10 minutes. This pre-softens the compressed fibers, allowing you to break the brick into a coarse meal with a sterilized chisel or heavy spoon without creating dust or requiring excessive physical force.

#### 2. Dry Ingredient Integration

Once the brick is broken down, add 2 quarts of vermiculite and 1/2 cup of gypsum. Mix thoroughly while dry to ensure the gypsum is evenly distributed throughout the coir fibers.

#### 3. Primary Hydration & Pasteurization

Add the remaining **3 to 4 quarts of boiling water**.

* **Pro Tip:** Start with 3.5 total quarts (including the initial 0.5) and adjust based on the specific brand of coir, as absorption rates vary.
Immediately seal the lid tightly to retain heat.

#### 4. The "Bucket Tek" Heat Cycle

Allow the bucket to sit undisturbed for **6 to 24 hours**. The internal temperature must remain above **140°F (60°C)** for at least 1.5–2 hours to effectively pasteurize the substrate while preserving beneficial thermophilic bacteria that help resist contamination.

#### 5. Field Capacity Verification

Before inoculation, verify the moisture content.

* **The Squeeze Test:** Take a handful of substrate and squeeze hard.
* **Target:** Only 2–3 drops of water should escape. If it runs like a faucet, it is over-hydrated; add a small amount of dry, vermiculite to compensate.
