\### Phase 1: Grain Selection & Analysis

Select grain based on cost-efficiency and inoculation points per volume.

\| Grain Type | Cost Effectiveness | Colonization Speed | Prep Difficulty | Notes |
\| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
\| \*\*Whole Oats\*\* | High | Moderate | Low | Very forgiving; cheap (feed stores). Best for bulk. |
\| \*\*Rye Berries\*\* | Low | High | Moderate | The gold standard nutritionally, but expensive. |
\| \*\*Millet\*\* | Moderate | Very High | Low (NSNS\*) | Highest inoculation points; prone to clumping if wet. |
\| \*\*Milo/Sorghum\*\* | High | Moderate | Moderate | Similar to Millet but harder shell. |

\*\*NSNS: No Soak, No Simmer (Millet specific).\*

\### Phase 2: Rinsing and Pre-Soak

\*This phase is critical for endospore germination, making sterilization effective.\*

1\. \*\*Rinse:\*\* Dump dry grain into a 5-gallon bucket or wash tub. Rinse with tap water, agitating aggressively to remove dust, chaff, and bug fragments. Repeat until water runs clear (usually 3-4 washes).
2\. \*\*Soak:\*\* Cover grain with water (fill 2-3 inches above grain line to account for expansion).
3\. \*\*Gypsum Addition:\*\* Add \*\*Gypsum (Calcium Sulfate)\*\* at a ratio of \*\*5% by dry grain weight\*\* (approx. 1 cup per 5 gallons of grain).
\* \*Function:\* pH buffer and anti-caking agent.

4\. \*\*Duration:\*\* Soak for \*\*12–24 hours\*\*. This signals dormant endospores to germinate, making them susceptible to thermal destruction in the autoclave.

\---

\### Phase 3: Thermal Hydration (The Simmer)

\*Target: Internal hydration without burst kernels.\*

1\. \*\*Transfer:\*\* Move soaked grain to a stock pot or industrial steam kettle.
2\. \*\*Boil:\*\* Bring water to a rolling boil.
3\. \*\*Simmer Duration:\*\*
\* \*\*Oats:\*\* 30–45 minutes.
\* \*\*Rye:\*\* 15–25 minutes.

4\. \*\*The "Thumb Nail" Test:\*\* Periodically scoop a few grains. You must be able to slice through the kernel with your fingernail, revealing a hydrated (white/translucent) center, but the shell must remain intact.
\* \*Failure State:\* If kernels are bursting (starchy white guts exploding out), you have over-hydrated. This leads to "wet rot" (Bacillus).

\---

\### Phase 4: Surface Evaporation & Bagging

\*Surface moisture is the #1 cause of bacterial contamination.\*

1\. \*\*Drain:\*\* Strain grain immediately while hot. The steam helps evaporate surface moisture.
2\. \*\*Spread:\*\* Layout grain on large drying screens or a clean table.
3\. \*\*The Tissue Test:\*\* Place a small pile of grain on a piece of toilet paper or paper towel for 10 seconds.
\* \*\*Pass:\*\* No wet spot on the paper.
\* \*\*Fail:\*\* Wet spot visible. Continue drying.

4\. \*\*Bagging:\*\* Load into 0.2-micron or 0.5-micron filter patch bags.
\* \*Standard Commercial Weight:\* 2.5kg (approx. 5.5 lbs) or 3kg blocks.
\* \*Jar Note:\* If using jars, fill to 75% capacity and use modified lids with synthetic filter discs.

\### Phase 5: Sterilization Cycle

\*Parameters for standard autoclaves or 23qt Pressure Cookers (e.g., Presto 23).\*

\| Parameter | Specification |
\| --- | --- |
\| \*\*Pressure\*\* | 15 PSI (min) - 18 PSI (ideal) |
\| \*\*Temperature\*\* | 121°C (250°F) |
\| \*\*Duration (Bags)\*\* | 120 - 150 Minutes |
\| \*\*Duration (Jars)\*\* | 90 - 120 Minutes |
\| \*\*Venting\*\* | Vent steam for 10 mins prior to sealing weight/valve to expel air pockets. |

\*\*Cooling Protocol:\*\*
Allow the PC/Autoclave to return to 0 PSI naturally. Do not manually vent; rapid decompression causes bags to expand and burst seals (or crack jars). Allow to cool to room temperature (approx. 8–12 hours) in front of a Laminar Flow Hood before inoculation.
