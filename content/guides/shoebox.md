<Callout type="info" text="The 6-quart shoebox is the standard for decentralized fruiting. It isolates contamination risks, requires zero modifications (no drilled holes or micropore tape), and dials in surface conditions naturally through the imperfect seal of the stock lid." />

**Objective:** **Spawn** fully colonized grain into prepared **CVG** (Coco Coir, Vermiculite, Gypsum) substrate and initiate fruiting.

### Phase 1: Spawning to Bulk

*Perform this phase in a clean, draft-free room. Wipe down all surfaces and the interior of your shoeboxes with 70% Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA).*

1. **The Ratio:** Use a **1:1 or 1:2 (Spawn : Substrate)** ratio by volume. For a 6-quart shoebox, 1 quart of fully colonized grain spawn to 2 quarts of CVG is optimal.
2. **Layering vs. Mixing:** * Add a 1-inch base layer of CVG to the bottom of the tub.
* Break up your grain spawn and mix it thoroughly with the remaining bulk CVG substrate inside the tub. An even distribution of inoculation points speeds up colonization.


3. **The Pseudo-Casing Layer:** Once thoroughly mixed, lightly pack the surface down to create a flat, even plane. Apply a final 1/4-inch layer of pure CVG over the top. No grains should be exposed. This prevents airborne contaminants from landing on nutrient-rich grain.
4. **Sealing:** Snap the stock lid onto the shoebox.

### Phase 2: Colonization & Fruiting

Shoeboxes self-regulate. The minimal air gaps in the stock lid provide just enough passive Fresh Air Exchange (FAE) for the mycelium to thrive without drying out the substrate.

| Growth Phase | Duration | Temperature | Lighting | Lid Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Colonization** | 10–14 Days | 72°F - 75°F | Ambient / None | Latched tight. Do not open. |
| **Pinning** | 5–10 Days | 68°F - 72°F | 12/12 Cycle (6500k) | Unlatched / Floating. |
| **Fruiting** | 3–7 Days | 68°F - 72°F | 12/12 Cycle (6500k) | Dub-tub (if canopy breaches lid). |

1. **Colonization (The Wait):** Place the sealed shoebox in a dark, temperature-stable environment. Do not open the lid. Opening the lid drops humidity and introduces contamination risks before the mycelium has secured the substrate.
2. **Inducing Fruiting Conditions:** Once the surface is 90-100% colonized (bright white mycelial growth), unlatch the lid and let it rest loosely on top of the tub. This slight gap introduces the necessary oxygen trigger for pinhead formation.
3. **Surface Conditions:** You should observe thousands of microscopic water droplets resting on the mycelium.
* *If dry:* Mist the sides of the tub and the air above the substrate with a fine-flair mister (do not spray the mycelium directly).
* *If pooling:* Increase FAE by sliding the lid back slightly.


4. **The "Dub-Tub" Shift:** As fruits mature, they will outgrow the height of a standard shoebox lid. Take a second, empty 6-quart shoebox, wipe it with IPA, and invert it over the top of your fruiting tub as a humidity dome to allow unrestricted vertical growth.
